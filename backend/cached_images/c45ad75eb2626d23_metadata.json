If we take away three green apples, how many apples are there in total?\n\n=== LAYOUT SPECIFICATION (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY) ===\n\nCRITICAL COUNT REQUIREMENTS (READ CAREFULLY - THESE ARE MANDATORY):\n- Show EXACTLY 1 green apples (not 0, not 2, precisely 1 items)\n- CRITICAL: The image MUST contain exactly 1 green apples, no more, no less\n- Count verification: When counting green apples in the image, the total must equal 1\n- Show EXACTLY 1 red apples (not 0, not 2, precisely 1 items)\n- CRITICAL: The image MUST contain exactly 1 red apples, no more, no less\n- Count verification: When counting red apples in the image, the total must equal 1\n- Show EXACTLY 3 green apples (not 2, not 4, precisely 3 items)\n- CRITICAL: The image MUST contain exactly 3 green apples, no more, no less\n- Count verification: When counting green apples in the image, the total must equal 3\n- Show EXACTLY 2 red apples (not 1, not 3, precisely 2 items)\n- CRITICAL: The image MUST contain exactly 2 red apples, no more, no less\n- Count verification: When counting red apples in the image, the total must equal 2\n\nVERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Before finalizing the image, COUNT each object type visually\n- Verify that the count matches EXACTLY what is specified above\n- If counts don't match, regenerate the image with correct counts\n- DO NOT approximate or estimate - use the EXACT numbers specified\n- Each object must be clearly visible and countable in the final image\n\nOBJECTS IN SCENE:\n1. There are three green apples and two red apples. If we take away three green apples, how many apples are there in total?: There are three green apples and two red apples.
