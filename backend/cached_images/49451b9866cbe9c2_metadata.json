  "prompt": "There are three green apples and two red apples. If we take away three green apples, how many apples are there in total?\r\n\r\n=== LAYOUT SPECIFICATION (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY) ===\r\n\r\nOBJECTS IN SCENE:\r\n1. 3 green + 2 red apples positioned at approximately 14% from left, 17% from top, wide shape\r\n2. green apple, object color: #c8e6c9 positioned at approximately 9% from left, 42% from top, square shape\r\n3. green apple, object color: #c8e6c9 positioned at approximately 24% from left, 42% from top, square shape\r\n4. red apple, object color: #ffcdd2 positioned at approximately 53% from left, 48% from top, square shape\r\n5. red apple, object color: #ffcdd2 positioned at approximately 66% from left, 48% from top, square shape\r\n6. green apple, object color: #c8e6c9 positioned at approximately 16% from left, 60% from top, square shape\r\n\r\n=== END LAYOUT SPECIFICATION ===\r\n\r\nFINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\nGenerate a realistic, educational visualization that follows the layout structure shown in the provided image.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\r\n1. REPLACE LAYOUT BOXES WITH REAL OBJECTS:\r\n   - Each box in the layout represents a real object (e.g., \"green apple\" box → render an actual green apple)\r\n   - Do NOT show the layout boxes/borders - replace them completely with photorealistic or illustrated versions of the actual objects\r\n   - Objects should be clearly recognizable and match their labels (e.g., green apples should look like real green apples)\r\n   - Maintain the spatial positions and relationships from the layout, but render objects naturally\r\n\r\n2. TEXT BOXES - NO BORDERS:\r\n   - For text elements, do NOT show rectangular boxes or borders\r\n   - Display the text naturally, as floating text or integrated into the scene\r\n   - Text should be readable and positioned where the layout indicates, but without visible borders or boxes\r\n   - Use appropriate font styling that fits an educational context\r\n\r\n3. COLOR AND BACKGROUND:\r\n   - Colors specified above (e.g., \"object color: #bbdefb\") refer to the actual object colors\r\n   - Use a neutral, clean background (white, light gray, or transparent) - do NOT use object colors for the background\r\n   - The background should be plain and unobtrusive to keep focus on the objects\r\n\r\n4. OVERALL STYLE:\r\n   - Create a realistic, educational visualization suitable for primary/elementary mathematics\r\n   - The image should look like a professional educational diagram, not a wireframe or layout sketch\r\n   - Objects should be clearly visible and countable\r\n   - Maintain the spatial arrangement from the layout but render everything as a finished, polished image\r\n",
