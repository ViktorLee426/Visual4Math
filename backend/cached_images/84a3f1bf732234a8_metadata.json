  "prompt": "Sam has 2 balloons. Mia has 3 balloons. How many balloons do they have altogether?\r\n\r\n=== LAYOUT SPECIFICATION (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY) ===\r\n\r\nOBJECTS TO RENDER (EACH BOX = EXACTLY ONE OBJECT):\r\n1. balloon (color: #DF536B) at 18% from left, 45% from top\r\n2. balloon (color: #e3f2fd) at 63% from left, 53% from top\r\n3. balloon (color: #e3f2fd) at 69% from left, 35% from top\r\n4. balloon (color: #e3f2fd) at 53% from left, 35% from top\r\n5. balloon (color: #DF536B) at 31% from left, 48% from top\r\n\r\nOBJECT COUNT SUMMARY:\r\n- 5 × balloon (color:\r\n\r\nTEXT ELEMENTS (DISPLAY AS TEXT ONLY, DO NOT RENDER AS OBJECTS):\r\n1. Text: \"Sam: 2, Mia: 3 balloons\" at 16% from left, 8% from top\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: The text elements above are LABELS/DESCRIPTIONS only. Do NOT render them as objects.\r\nOnly render the objects listed in \"OBJECTS TO RENDER\" section above.\r\n\r\n=== END LAYOUT SPECIFICATION ===\r\n\r\nFINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\nTransform the layout diagram into a finished educational visualization.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\r\n1. OBJECT COUNTING - EXACT MATCH:\r\n   - Render EXACTLY the number of objects specified in \"OBJECT COUNT SUMMARY\" above\r\n   - Each object box in the layout = EXACTLY ONE rendered object\r\n   - Do NOT duplicate objects or add extra objects\r\n   - Example: If there are 3 \"green apple\" boxes, render exactly 3 green apples, no more, no less\r\n\r\n2. REPLACE LAYOUT BOXES WITH OBJECTS:\r\n   - Each box in the layout represents ONE object (e.g., \"green apple\" box → render ONE green apple)\r\n   - Do NOT show the layout boxes/borders - replace them completely with rendered objects\r\n   - Objects can be cartoon-style, illustrated, or realistic - your choice, but make them clear and recognizable\r\n   - Objects should match their labels (e.g., green apples should be green apples)\r\n   - Maintain the spatial positions from the layout\r\n\r\n3. TEXT ELEMENTS - NO BOXES:\r\n   - For text elements listed above, display ONLY the text content\r\n   - Do NOT show rectangular boxes, borders, or backgrounds around text\r\n   - Display text naturally as floating text, positioned where specified\r\n   - Text should be readable and integrated into the scene\r\n\r\n4. COLOR AND BACKGROUND:\r\n   - Use the colors specified for objects (e.g., green apples should be green)\r\n   - Use a neutral, clean background (white or light gray)\r\n   - Background should be plain and unobtrusive\r\n\r\n5. OVERALL STYLE:\r\n   - Create a clear, educational visualization suitable for primary/elementary mathematics\r\n   - Style can be cartoon, illustrated, or realistic - choose what works best\r\n   - Objects should be clearly visible and countable\r\n   - Render as a finished, polished educational image\r\n",
