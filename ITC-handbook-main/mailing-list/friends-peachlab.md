The following is some basic information about your mailing list.

Your mailing list password is:

`bjaFPtg7hjvcfvTP`

You need this password to configure your mailing list.  You also need

it to handle administrative requests, such as approving mail if you

choose to run a moderated list.

You can configure your mailing list at the following web page:

https://lists.inf.ethz.ch/mailman/admin/friends.peachlab

The web page for users of your mailing list is:

https://lists.inf.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/friends.peachlab

You can even customize these web pages from the list configuration

page.  However, you do need to know HTML to be able to do this.

There is also an email-based interface for users (not administrators)

of your list; you can get info about using it by sending a message

with just the word `help' as subject or in the body, to:

[friends.peachlab-request@lists.inf.ethz.ch](mailto:friends.peachlab-request@lists.inf.ethz.ch)

To unsubscribe a user: from the mailing list 'listinfo' web page,

click on or enter the user's email address as if you were that user.

Where that user would put in their password to unsubscribe, put in

your admin password.  You can also use your password to change

member's options, including digestification, delivery disabling, etc.

Please address all questions to

[mailman-owner@lists.inf.ethz.ch](mailto:mailman-owner@lists.inf.ethz.ch)
